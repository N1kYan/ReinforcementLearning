\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) arises from Deterministic Policy 
Gradients (DPG) and Deep Q-Learning (DQN). In the following we describe the 
underlying algorithms DPG and DQN and which aspects DDPG uses of both of them. 

\subsection{Deep Q-Learning (DQN) }
\nocite{mnih2015human}
\nocite{mnih2013playing}
\label{sec:DQN}
The DQN approach combines the approximation power of Neural Networks with traditional Q-learning.
It enables solving the classic Reinforcement Learning problem of achieving the maximum expected reward over time, even for large state spaces (e.g. image frames). The algorithm is an off-policy, model-free approach and is able to find a close to optimal action-value function for many cases [x] and from this a close to optimal deterministic policy by greedily selecting the action: $\pi(s)=\max_{a}Q^*(s,a)$. In terms of a formula the optimal action-value function is represented by
\[ 
Q^*(s_t,a_t)=\max_\pi E \left[
\sum_{t^{'}=t}^{T}\gamma^{t^{'}-t}r_{t^{'}}|s_t=s,
a_t=a, \pi \right] 
\]
%TODO E richtig darstellen
 where $\gamma\in[0,1)$ is called the \textit{Discount Factor}, controlling the agents preference for rewards closer or further away in time. Rewards later on in an episode will still have impact on the result but their influence decreases by the amount of time-steps required to reach them in the future.
By definition this optimal value function yields the \textit{Bellman Equation} [x] and can be reinterpreted as maximizing the current reward and the discounted action-value of the resulting state. In formula this gives:
\[
Q^*(s,a) = E_{s'\sim\epsilon}\left[
r + \gamma \max_{a'}Q^*(s',a')|s,a \right]
\]
%TODO E
For approximating the action-value function $Q(s,a|\theta)\approx Q^*(s,a)$ the approach uses a deep neural network, called the Q-Network.
The Q-Network can be trained by minimizing a sequence of loss functions $L_i(\theta_i)$, depending on it's weights:
\[
L_i(\theta_i)=E_{s,a\sim\rho(.),s'\sim\epsilon}
\left[\left(r+\gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', 
a'|\theta_{i-1})-Q(s,a|\theta_i)\right)^2\right] 
\]
%TODO E richtig machen
This loss function is similiar to the classical temporal-difference loss used in Q-Learning, but with approximated action-value functions instead of lookup-tables. Derivating this loss w.r.t. the approximation's weights gives:
\[
\nabla_{\theta_i}L_i(\theta_i)=E_{s,a\sim\rho(.),s'\sim\epsilon}
\left[\left(r+\gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', 
a'|\theta_{i-1})-Q(s,a|\theta_i)\right)\nabla_{\theta_i}Q(s,a|\theta_i)\right] 
\]
The expectation can be obtained by samling and this gradient can be used to optimize the loss function by using stochastic gradient descent.\\
Furthermore, a replay buffer is used which stores samples of the environment. This allows random mini-batch sampling, which decorrelates the samples and is proven to improve the performance by greater data efficiency [x]. The mini-batch sampling also enables the use of improved derivatives of vanilla stochastic gradient descent, e.g. \textit{RPROP} as in the \textit{neural fitted Q-Learning (NFQ)} [x] approach or \textit{ADAM update} [x].\\
%TODO Rewrite the target network stuff
There are different ways of estimating the expected Q-values. Either with a target network with the same structure as the network for the action-value function or the normal network. If a target network is used, the target weights need to be updated after some 
training steps.\\
A pseudocode for the DQN approach can be found in \ref{DQN-algo}.
The DQN approach was able to significantly outperform earlier learning methods despite incorporating almost no prior knowledge about the inputs [x], but is limited by the disabilty to cope with continous and high-dimensional action spaces due to the max operator in the action selection [x]. This limitations can be adressed by combining the approach with the Deterministic Policy Gradient, which is described in the following section.

			\begin{cases}
			r_i & \textit{if episode terminates at step i+1}\\
			r_i+\gamma \max_{a'}\hat{Q}(s_{i+1}, a'|\theta^{-})& 
			else\\			
			\end{cases}$
		\STATE perform gradient descent on $\left(q_i-Q\left(s_i, 
		a_i|\theta\right)\right)^2_\theta$
		\STATE every $C$ steps update $\hat{Q}=Q$

\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG)}
\label{sec:DPG}
\nocite{lillicrap2015continuous}
As [x] stated correctly, most problems in reinforcement learning consist of a continuous action space which makes it very difficult to greedily choose the best action given a policy, due to the max operator. From a stochastic point of view, the policy is a probability distribution $a\sim\pi(a|s)$ over all actions. In order to calculate the gradient of a parameterized policy $\pi(a,s|\theta)$ over the total reward w.r.t. the weights, one needs to solve an integral over all actions and states, which becomes untractable for large state-action spaces.
From a deterministic view the policy is a discrete mapping from states to actions $a=\pi(s)$ and thus only one integration over the state space is sufficient.\\ 
%TODO Explain likelihood ratio gradients?
The \textit{policy gradient theorem} [EDIT: QUELLE] gives the update rule for a parameterized policy, optimizing the loss function: 
\[
\nabla_{\theta}J(\theta)=E_{s\sim\rho^\pi,a\sim\pi_\theta}
\left[\nabla_\theta log \pi_\theta(a|s)Q^\pi(s,a)\right] 
\]
From this, a deterministic approach is derived in [EDIT: by?] [x], which gives the update rule for a parameterized deterministic policy function $\pi(s|\theta)$. Rather than trying to maximize the action-value function $Q(s,a)$ globally by greedy improvements of the policy, the authors move the policy in the direction of the gradient of $Q(s,a)$:
\[
\nabla_{\theta^\pi}J\approx E_{s_t\sim\rho^\beta}\left[\nabla_{\theta^\pi}Q(s,a|\theta^Q)\right]
\]
%TODO s  ... Beta or Pi?
Applying the chain rule to this equation gives the \textit{deterministic policy gradient theorem}:
\begin{align*}
\nabla_{\theta^\pi}J\approx E_{s_t\sim\rho^\beta}\left[\nabla_aQ(s,a|\theta^Q)|_{s=s_t,a=\pi(st)} \nabla_{\theta^\pi}\pi(s|\theta^\pi)|_{s=s_t}\right]
\end{align*}
where the expectation can again be obtained from sampling from an environment.
Only using deterministic action outputs will vanish the algorithms exploration, so one needs to make sure there still is exploration [EDIT: WORTWAHL]. This is realized by using an off-policy approach which follows a stochastic behavior policy while learning about a deterministic target policy. The authors also introduce the notion of \textit{compatible function approximation}. Using these to extimate the gradient, an unbiased approximation is guaranteed.\\
%TODO Explain compatible FA
%TODO Probleme mit DPG und nns beschreiben -> DDPG
\subsection{Actor-Critic Methods}
\label{sec:actor-critic}
The advantage of actor-critic methods is that they learn policies as well as 
value functions. To get an intuition about these methods the following figure 
illustrates the update-cycle:
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{actor-critic}
	\caption{Intuition about actor-critic methods (figure from 
	\cite{sutton2018reinforcement})}
	\label{fig:actor-critic}
\end{figure}
The actor is responsible for the change of the policies, the critic has to 
update the parameter of the state-value function. Updating the actors' and the 
critics' parameter follows the TD-error of the critic which is produced through 
the reward and the current error of the estimated state values. As Fig. 
\ref{fig:actor-critic} illustrates, the actor has no information about the 
current reward and the critic has no direct influence on the actions.  
%TODO direct influence richtig formuliert?
The update of actor and critic can be formulated as follows:
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{actor-critic-algo}
	\caption{Intuition about actor-critic methods (figure from 
		\cite{sutton2018reinforcement})}
	\label{fig:actor-critic-algo}
\end{figure}
%TODO if we want it, change it to self written

\section{Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)}
\label{sec:DDPG}
\nocite{lillicrap2015continuous}
The combination of above approaches led to the \textit{Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)} approach [x], which is a model-free and off-policy algorithm. It can be grouped into the class of policy gradient algorithms and uses actor-critic methods with a deterministic target policy and deep Q-learning. Both, the actor and the critic, are realized by deep neural networks. The pseudocode for DDPG can be found in \ref{DDPG-algo}.
%TODO Add refference
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)}\label{DDPG-algo}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\REQUIRE Replay buffer $\mathit{D}$ with high capacity
		\REQUIRE Critic network $Q(s,a|\theta^Q)$ and actor network $\pi(s|\theta^\pi)$ with random weights $\theta^Q$ and $\theta^\pi$
		\REQUIRE Initialize target networks $Q'$ and $\pi'$ with weights $\theta^{Q'}\leftarrow\theta^Q$ and $\theta^{\pi'}\leftarrow\theta^\pi$
		\FOR{episode $1$ \TO $M$}
		\STATE Initialize random process $\mathit{N}$ for action exploration
		\STATE Reset environment to state $s_1$
		\FOR{$t=1$ \TO $T$}
		\STATE Select action $a_t = \pi(s_t|\theta^\pi) + \mathit{N}_t$ from local actor
		\STATE Execute action $a_t$ and observe reward $r_t$ and next state $s_{t+1}$
		\STATE Save $(s_t, a_t, r_t,s_{t+1})$ in replay buffer $D$
		\STATE Sample minibatch $(s_i, a_i, r_i,s_{i+1})$ from $D$
		\STATE Set TD-target from target networks:\\
		\qquad $y_i = r_i + \gamma Q'(s_{i+1}, \pi'(s_{i+1}|\theta^{\pi'})|\theta^{Q'})$
		\STATE Update the critic by minimizing the loss:\\
		\qquad $L=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i(y_i - Q(s_i,a_i|\theta^Q))^2$
		\STATE Update the actor using the sampled policy gradient:\\ 			\qquad $\nabla_{\theta^\pi}J \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \nabla_a Q(s,a|\theta^Q)|_{s=s_i, a=\pi(s_i)}\nabla_{\theta^\pi}\pi(s|\theta^\pi)|_{s=s_i}$
		\STATE Update the target networks:\\
		\qquad $\theta^{Q'}\leftarrow \tau \theta^Q + (1-\tau)\theta^{Q'}$\\
		\qquad $\theta^{\pi'}\leftarrow \tau \theta^\pi + (1-\tau)\theta^{\pi'}$
		\ENDFOR
		\ENDFOR

\begin{itemize}
\item DQN uses deep networks to estimate the action-value function
\begin{itemize}
\item it can only handle discrete and low-dim action spaces
\end{itemize}
\item discretizing the action space often suffers from the course of dimensionality
\item PolicyGradientTheorem from continous space to discrete space presented in DPG paper
\item naive extension of DPG with nns turns out to be unstable for challenging problems
\item Deep DPG (DDPG): combination of DQN and DPG, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item networks are trained off-policy with samples from a replay buffer to minimize the temporal correlations between samples
\item the networks are trained with target networks to give consistent targets during temporal difference backups
\item batch normalization is used
\end{itemize}
\item DDPG is able to learn from low dim observations (torques etc.), aswell as from high dim observations in pixel space
