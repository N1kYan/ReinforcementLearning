## Programming Challenge 3: Policy Gradient Methods

#### Tasks

1. Implement vanilla policy gradient (i.e., REINFORCE <http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~barto/courses/cs687/williams92simple.pdf>) on Levitation-v0
2. Implement natural policy gradient (e.g., as described in <https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02660>) on BallBalancerSim-v0
3. Implement an algorithm that explores in the parameter space (e.g., as described in <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/wierstra14a/wierstra14a.pdf>) on BallBalancerSim-v0

#### Evaluation

As usually, cumulative episode reward over a range of random seeds.
